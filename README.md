# The-Wonder-Jewels-.Co
The Wonder Jewels .Co is a three page static and navigable webpage that is designed for a imaginary jewellery shop as a part of the very first webpage creation project.

The webpage contains navigable tabs for:
1. Charms & Bracelets
2. Rings
3. Earrings
4. Necklace and Pendants
5. Gifts
6. Discover

This is a part of a beginner's understanding of how a webpage is supposed to be created implementing different basic HTML techniques, like Search Bar, Buttons Styles and Formats, Navigation Bars, Response of the tabs, Uploading Media and so on.

This webpage is completely made using HTML and CSS languages with a Pink Pallette in mind to give it a more balanced and feminine look. The images have been obtained through different shopping sites online.
